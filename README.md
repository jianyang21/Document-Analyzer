# Content Extraction and Question Answering System

## Project Overview
This project is designed to extract content from various sources such as images, websites, and PDF files. It then translates the content into English (if necessary) and answers questions based on the extracted content. The project leverages several powerful tools including OpenCV (`cv2`) for image processing, Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Beautiful Soup for web scraping, and PDF Reader for extracting content from PDF files.

## Features
- **Image Content Extraction:** Utilizes `cv2` and Tesseract to extract text from images.
- **Web Content Extraction:** Uses `BeautifulSoup` to scrape content from the internet.
- **PDF Content Extraction:** Employs a PDF reader to extract and process content from PDF files.
- **Language Translation:** Automatically translates the extracted content into English.
- **Question Answering:** Provides answers to questions based on the processed content.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/content-extraction-qa.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd content-extraction-qa
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Extracting Content from Images:**
    ```python
    import cv2
    import pytesseract

    image = cv2.imread('path_to_image')
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
    print(text)
    ```

2. **Scraping Content from the Web:**
    ```python
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import requests

    url = 'https://example.com'
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    content = soup.get_text()
    print(content)
    ```

3. **Reading Content from PDF Files:**
    ```python
    import PyPDF2

    with open('path_to_pdf', 'rb') as file:
        reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(file)
        text = ''
        for page in range(reader.numPages):
            text += reader.getPage(page).extract_text()
        print(text)
    ```

4. **Translating Content to English:**
    ```python
    from googletrans import Translator

    translator = Translator()
    translated_text = translator.translate(text, dest='en').text
    print(translated_text)
    ```

5. **Answering Questions:**
    ```python
    # Use NLP models such as BERT or GPT for question answering
    # Example code snippet here
    ```
